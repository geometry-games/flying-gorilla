## Flying Gorilla: Banana-Fueled Aerial Adventure

Experience gravity-defying excitement in **Flying Gorilla**, the ultimate endless runner featuring everyone's favorite airborne primate. This addictive mobile game transforms simple swipe controls into hours of entertainment as your gorilla soars through vibrant landscapes collecting bananas.

## Why Flying Gorilla Stands Out

### Simple Yet Challenging Gameplay
Flying Gorilla's intuitive swipe mechanics make it easy to pick up but hard to master. With just left and right movements, you'll navigate through increasingly complex obstacle courses while Flying Gorilla accelerates to thrilling speeds.

### Hilarious Customization Options
Personalize your Flying Gorilla experience with wacky skins including:
- Business Suit Gorilla
- Superhero Gorilla
- Pizza Chef Gorilla
Each costume adds unique visual flair without affecting the core Flying Gorilla gameplay.

### Progressive Difficulty Curve
Flying Gorilla starts deceptively simple but quickly ramps up the challenge. The game dynamically adjusts obstacle frequency and speed based on your performance, ensuring Flying Gorilla remains engaging for both casual and hardcore players.

### Global Competition
Track your Flying Gorilla high scores on worldwide leaderboards. Compare your banana collection totals with friends and rivals to see who truly masters this aerial adventure.

## Mastering Flying Gorilla's Skies

### Basic Movement (Early Game)
The first 30 seconds of Flying Gorilla teach fundamental swipe mechanics. Practice precise timing to slip between early obstacles while collecting bonus bananas.

### Speed Adaptation (Mid Game)
As Flying Gorilla accelerates, develop strategies for:
- Anticipating obstacle patterns
- Managing rapid direction changes
- Optimizing banana collection routes

### Endurance Challenge (Late Game)
True Flying Gorilla experts survive beyond the 2-minute mark where:
- Obstacle density triples
- Visual effects intensify
- Special gold bananas appear

## Flying Gorilla Evolution

Originally launched as a simple endless runner, Flying Gorilla has grown through multiple updates:
- Added 15+ character skins
- Introduced daily challenge modes
- Implemented cloud save functionality
The current version of Flying Gorilla represents the most polished and feature-rich iteration yet.
